# How To Use QA Test Scripts #

## Special Note on Test Reports
The QA Report Files generated by the UnitTest and TestCase scripts have been designed and formatted so that the QA Reports will only change when there is a change in a test result.  Specifically, there are no user-names or timestamps or absolute filepaths in the test results.  This allows Github to conveniently track the history of test results with source-code changes, and allows developers and QA testers to notified by Github or their git client when there are any changes and the exact test that changed its result.

## Run all UnitTests and automated Test Cases for all bridge projects
1. Start Daz Studio.
2. Open the Script IDE Pane.
3. Load "Test/RunAllTests.dsa".
4. Configure "sCommonPath" on line 10 to point to the correct absolute path containing the RunAllTests.dsa script.
5. Configure "Global_sOutputPath" on line 13 to point to the absolute path of the "Test/Results/" folder.
6. Make sure the correct absolute path is specified for DzUnreal and DzUnity scripts.  Comment out any sections you do not wish to run.
7. Run the script by clicking "Execute" or pressing <F5>.

## Run only UnitTests
1. Start Daz Studio.
2. Open the Script IDE Pane.
3. Load "Test/UnitTests/RunUnitTests.dsa".
4. Configure the "sIncludePath" to point to the correct absolute path containing the RunUnitTests.dsa script.
5. Configure the "sOutputPath" to pont to the absolute path of the "Test/Results" folder.
6. Run the script.

## Run all Automated Test Cases for a specific bridge project
1. Start Daz Studio.
2. Open the Script IDE Pane.
3. Load "<DzBridge-project>/Test/TestCases/test_runner.dsa" for whatever desired bridge project, such as DazToUnreal or DazToUnity.
4. Configure "sIncludePath" to point to the correct absolute path containing the test_runner.dsa script.
5. Configure "Global_sOutputPath" to point to the absolute path of the "<DzBridge-project>/Test/Results/" folder.
6. Run the script.

## Run a single Automated Test Case for a specific bridge project
1. Start Daz Studio.
2. Open the Script IDE Pane.
3. Load "<DzBridge-project>/Test/TestCases/test_runner--single.dsa" for whatever desired bridge project, such as DazToUnreal or DazToUnity.
4. Configure "sIncludePath" to point to the correct absolute path containing the test_runner--single.dsa script.
5. Configure "Global_sOutputPath" to point to the absolute path of the "<DzBridge-project>/Test/Results/" folder.
6. Copy-Paste or uncomment the line for the desired Test Case(s) you wish to run.
